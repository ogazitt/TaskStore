            An early-stage, self-funded startup out of the Seattle area, builtsteady inc.
            is currently developing personal productivity software that integrates
            with and enriches the existing digital products consumers use today.

            In the coming months we will be describing product scenarios and providing early
            previews of the software in order to solicit user feedback. If interested in
            participating in our early-adopter program, please provide an email address.
